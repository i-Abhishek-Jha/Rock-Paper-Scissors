# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

A simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game implemented in Python where the user plays against the computer.

## How It Works
- The user chooses one option: `rock (r)`, `paper (p)`, or `scissors (s)`.
- The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
- The winner is decided based on the classic rules:
  - Rock beats Scissors
  - Paper beats Rock
  - Scissors beats Paper
- The game announces whether the user won, lost, or it was a draw.
